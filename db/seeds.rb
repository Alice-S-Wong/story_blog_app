# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# Story.create(title: "My Second Story", description: "This is my story. Hope you read it.", release_date: "2020-02-20", author_id: 1)

# Author.create(pen_name: "Jane Doe", bio: "A relatively unknown author.")
